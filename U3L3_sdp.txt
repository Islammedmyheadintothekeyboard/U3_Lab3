1. The base case is when the list argument's length hits 1.
2. The list argument's length will keep shrinking towards one as the list keeps on getting split in half.
3. For communicating I think floor division will be useful as to avoid floats when indexing, since I will be using splicing and dividing the list's length by two to determine where to cut.
4. It is a more efficient method to use compared to others and is faster.
